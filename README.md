# SapceShip - Titanic

Project for the Kaggle competition "Spaceship Titanic" (for more info https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic).  
The main is composed of a first part of data analysis with NaN imputation and some visualization. Then I used two models: **XGBoost** and **Multi-Layer Perceptron**. For every model there is a training and an evaluation of predictions on a testing dataset.   
Then in the prediction notebook I used the two models on the testing dataset given by Kaggle for the predictions requested by the competition and I created a final dataset (*results.csv*) with both the predictions.
